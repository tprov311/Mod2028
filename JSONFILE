The outgoing Trump administration entered office with a clear mandate, but as the economy faltered, infighting took hold, leading to its decline. In the Republican primaries, J.D. Vance emerged victorious, propelled by Trump’s endorsement and growing concerns over automation. On the Democratic side, Wes Moore swept to victory on a wave of populist support from the urban poor, rallying around his vision for urban reform. Now, with automation rapidly eliminating jobs and the collapse of Saudi Arabia destabilizing the Middle East, the question remains: Who will lead America through the final years of the turbulent 2020s.",
